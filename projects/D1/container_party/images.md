# Docker Images

The image is like the template that Docker uses to spawn containers. Just like a class is used to create objects (if you are a developer), or the binary file is used to launch processes (if you are a sysadmin).

A typical image contains:

1. **Files:** like application binaries, dependencies, libraries, kernel modules and so on
1. **Metadata:** instructions for how the container will behave. For example, which process it will run, which network ports it will expose, which volumes it will use for persistent storage, among other settings.
