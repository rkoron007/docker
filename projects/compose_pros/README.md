# Becoming a Compose Pro

## Overview

In the words of Docker Inc. `Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your applicationâ€™s services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.` As you learned in the Compose readings you can define a complex stack in one a file and have it running with a single command! No more separate tabs running commands for your database command and your front end command. No more defining containers by hand! The people at Docker choose to call this gift, Docker Compose.

### Workflow:




# Phase 1: The Voting App
We will be creating the `docker-compose.yml` file for voting for "cats vs. dogs". Users can cats their votes, which will be saved, and admin users can see the votes vast. It is a simple application based on micro-services architecture, consisting of 5 individually simple services.

![voting-app](https://assets.aaonline.io/Docker/voting.png)

1. Voting-App: The frontend of the application written in Python, used by users to cast their votes.
2. Redis: The in-memory database, used as intermediate storage.
3. Worker: A .Net service, used to fetch votes from Redis and store in a Postres database.
4. DB: A PostgreSQL database, used as database.
5. Result-App: Frontend of the application written in Node.js, displays the voting results.

All of the images you need are on Docker Hub. We will creating the services including exposing ports, volumes, and connecting containers thorough our own networks. Let's get started!

### Services 

So you'll be creating 5 separate services and pulling their images from Docker Hub. The **names of these services do matter**  for the images, so make sure you use the name as described below.  You'll be creating two [custom networks][compose-custom] "frontend" and "backend".

[compose-custom]: https://docs.docker.com/compose/networking/#specify-custom-networks


### Services 

**Service One: vote**
- The frontend of the application written in Python
- The image will be `dockersamples/examplevotingapp_vote:before`
- The locally exposed port should be `5000`. 
    - The container's internally exposed port should be `80`
- On the frontend Network


**Service Two: redis**:
- The in-memory key/value storage for incoming votes
- The image will be `redis:3.2`
- No exposed ports
- On the Frontend Network

**Service Three: worker**
- Used to fetch votes from Redis and store in a Postres database.
- The image is `dockersamples/examplevotingapp_worker`
- No public ports
- On both the frontend and backend networks


**Service Four: db**
- The database, enough said. 
- The image will be `postgres:9.4`
- One [named volume][named-v] will be needed, pointing to `/var/lib/postgresql/data` in order to persist data.
- On the backend network

**Service Five: result**
- The node web app that shows results to administrators
- The image is `dockersamples/examplevotingapp_result:before`
- Run this service with the local port of 5001, and the container listening on 80
- On backend network

Now try it all together! Run `docker-compose up`. Notice that when you specify custom networks Docker Compose doesn't automatically make a network for you:

```
Creating network "phase_frontend" with the default driver
Creating network "phase_backend" with the default driver
```

Go to `http://localhost:5000` and you should be able to vote for either "dogs" or "cats". Once you've cast your vote refresh and make sure your vote persisted. Now checkout `http://localhost:5001` and you'll see the `result` service at work as your can look on the number of votes and who voted for what. 

Awesome job! After you've debated about cats vs. dogs in your heart move onto the next phase.
