# Docker Container Health Checks

## Overview
Health Checks are exactly what they sound like - a way of checking the health of some resource. In the case of Docker, a [`HEALTHCHECK`][hc] is a command used to determine the health of a running container. Docker introduced Container Health Checks in version 1.12. Docker Container Health Checks are supported in a Dockerfile, the `docker container run` command, Docker Compose, and in Docker Swarm. 

The `HEALTHCHECK` instruction tells Docker how to test a container to check that it is still working. A good health check can detect cases such as a web server that is stuck in an infinite loop and unable to handle new connections, even though the server process is still running. 

## Why You Should Health Check
Well, to be honest, in a small scale development case it may not make that much of a difference because we're usually just running a container or two. However, even while working in development, one of your containers could go down without a "hard fail", leaving the container running without the service running. So the normal state of the container would be "running" even though we are no longer serving traffic. Knowing about Health Checks is always useful.

So to be specific, Docker Health Checks are most helpful in a **production** environment. Learning and practicing using them now, in development, will prepare you for production!

## Docker Container Health
When a container has a HealthCheck specified, it has a health status in addition to its normal status. A Docker container can have three health statuses:

  1. `starting`: This takes up to 30 seconds to run, and represents the process of the container booting up
  2. `healthy`: The container will continue to run its Health Check at every specified interval
  3. `unhealthy`:  After a certain number of consecutive failures the container's status will be unhealthy

## HealthCheck Syntax

### Docker Container Run Health Checks

You can run Health Checks on containers in a variety of ways. Below is an example of using a HealthCheck with Postgres for the specific command that the Database is ready for oncoming traffic. 

To ensure a HealthCheck is running properly you will always need your container to fail by having it `exit 1` or return `false`.  

```
docker container run --name p2 -d --health-cmd="pg_isready -U postgres || exit 1" postgres 
```

Now that your HealthCheck is set up you should be able to see it in `docker container ls`:

```
$ docker container ls  
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS                   PORTS               NAMES
d68125e29c04        postgres            "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦"   4 minutes ago       Up 4 minutes (healthy)   5432/tcp            p2
```

You can also check the status of your HealthCheck by inspecting your container using:

```
docker container inspect --format='{{json .State.Health}}' your-container-name
```


### Dockerfile Health Checks
The syntax for using a Container HealthCheck in a Dockerfile is:

```docker
HEALTHCHECK [OPTIONS] CMD command
```

A typical HealthCheck might be to ensure traffic is flowing to our container by using the `curl` command adding something like this to your Dockerfile:

```ssh
HEALTHCHECK CMD curl --fail http://localhost:3000/ || exit 1
```

### Docker Compose Syntax for Health Checks

The minimum Docker Compose version needed for Health Checks is 2.1, though to use the `start_period` option the minimum Compose version is 3.4.

Here is the example of using a Compose with a HealthCheck:

```yml
    version: "3.4" 
    services:
        web:
        image: nginx
        healthcheck:
            test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost"]
            interval: 1m30s
            timeout: 10s
            retries: 3
                start_period: 1m #minimum version 3.4 of DockerCompose
```
