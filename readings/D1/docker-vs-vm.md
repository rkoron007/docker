# Using Docker vs. Using a Virtual Machine
Virtual machines contain a complete operating system and applications. Hypervisor-based virtualization is resource intensive, and a Virtual Machine can take up several GB depending on the OS. In general, VMs provide an environment with more resources than most applications need.

On the other hand Docker containers are executed with the Docker engine. Containers are lightweight because they don’t need the extra load of a hypervisor, but run directly within the host machine’s kernel. This means you can run more containers on a given hardware combination than if you were using virtual machines.
