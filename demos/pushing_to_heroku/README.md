## Pushing to Heroku Example: Using Rails and React

In this demo we'll be walking through how we Docker-ized an application and then
deployed that application to the Heroku Container Registry. The application
we'll be using for this demo will look pretty familiar - it's
[Pokedex][pokedex](click here to download and view the files we wrote)! We'll
walk through how we created a Dockerfile for the two main services in our
application (Rails and React) and what configuration changes we ended up making
along the way.

## Running the Application Locally Using Docker

### Rails Dockerfile

We'll start by building the Dockerfile for the Rails side of things. We used
this [docker-compose][docker-c] guide to as our starting point to building a
Rails Dockerfile.

The first thing we did was create a new file named `entrypoint.sh` to fix a
Rails-specific Docker issue that prevents the server from restarting when a
`server.pid` file exists:

```sh
#!/bin/bash
set -e

# Remove a potentially pre-existing server.pid for Rails.
# If Rails sees another server.pid it will think another Rails server is already
# runnning and will terminate.
rm -f ./my_app/tmp/pids/server.pid

# Then exec the container's main process (what's set as CMD in the Dockerfile).
exec "$@"
```

Then we went had to change our database configuration to make sure it would hook
up to the Postgres database we will later define in our `docker-compose` file:

```yml
# config/database.yml
default: &default
  adapter: postgresql
  encoding: unicode
  # Here we make sure we can pass the connection URL for the database
  url: <%= ENV['DATABASE_URL'] %>
  pool: <%= ENV.fetch("RAILS_MAX_THREADS") { 5 } %>

development:
  <<: *default
  database: pokedex_development

test:
  <<: *default
  database: pokedex_test

production:
  <<: *default
  adapter: postgresql
  host: db
  username: postgres
  # we don't need to specify a password
  password:
```

Finally we created our `Dockerfile`. We used a multi-stage build in order to
first bundle our React assets before moving on to build our Rails application.
Take a look at the comments below and then we will walk through how it works:

```dockerfile
# PHASE ONE:
# Here we are compiling our frontend assets
# Since we only need need Node for generating our bundle
# we will use a multi-stage build to keep our image small

# The below layers will NOT be included in the final image

# setting up our image aliased as build
FROM node:12.2.0-alpine as build

# set working directory inside node
WORKDIR /usr/src/node_app

# environment vars must be included in dockerfile
ARG NODE_ENV=production

# Add our node modules to our path
ENV PATH /usr/src/node_app/node_modules/.bin:$PATH

# copy over our package.json
COPY package.json /usr/src/node_app/package.json

#  install dependencies silently so we don't have to
#  watch the whole thing download every time
RUN npm install --silent

# Copy over the rest of our file so webpack will be able bundle it
COPY . /usr/src/node_app

# this is the most important line!
#  This is where we will create our bundle files that we will copy over later!
# npm run postinstall will run the command: "webpack --mode=production"
RUN npm run postinstall


# PHASE TWO:
# this will be the actual base image of the image we are building
# We are going from the alpine version of ruby to save space
FROM ruby:2.5.5-alpine3.9

# We tell the image `--no-cache` so we don't
# clog up our image with the things we are downloading
RUN apk add --no-cache --update build-base \
  linux-headers \
  git \
  postgresql-dev \
  nodejs \
  tzdata


# environment vars must be included in the dockerfile
ARG DATABASE_URL="postgres://postgres@db"
ARG RAILS_ENV=production

# copy over our Gemfile
WORKDIR /my_app
COPY Gemfile /my_app/Gemfile
COPY Gemfile.lock /my_app/Gemfile.lock

# We gem install bundler for a specific issue with bundler 2.0
# then we can bundle install
RUN gem install bundler && bundle install
COPY . /my_app

# Here is where that build stage from earlier comes in. We don't need all the
# Javascript dependencies just the bundle files! So we will copy those over into
# our final image
COPY --from=build /usr/src/node_app/app/assets/javascripts/bundle.js ./app/assets/javascripts/
COPY --from=build /usr/src/node_app/app/assets/javascripts/bundle.js.map ./app/assets/javascripts/

# Add a script to be executed every time the container starts.
# This script will take care of a Rails specific Docker issue
COPY entrypoint.sh /usr/bin/
RUN chmod +x /usr/bin/entrypoint.sh

# Expose our port
EXPOSE 3000

# Start the main process.
CMD ["rails", "server", "-b", "0.0.0.0"]
```

Since our Rails application only needs Node in order to bundle our dependencies
we use a multistage build to first build our `bundle.js` and our
`bundle.js.map`. The majority of the layers in Phase One will not be added to
our final image.

Once we start Phase Two we are actually building the base image for our image.
So the base image for our app will be `ruby:2.5.5-alpine3.9`. Then we take care
of installing all our Ruby dependencies. You'll notice two very long `COPY`
lines after we `bundle install`. This is where we will be using the files that
we created earlier with that node image! We take just the `bundle.js` and the
`bundle.js.map` and add them to the `javascripts` folder within the image file
system we are creating. Finally we add the script we wrote earlier to take care
of the Rails `server.pid` Docker problem we described earlier.

Then we expose our port and start our server!

## Docker Compose file

Now we can use our nifty new Dockerfile and make sure everything runs locally by
setting up a `docker-compose.yml`:

```yml
version: "3"
services:
  db:
    image: postgres
    volumes:
      - ./tmp/db:/var/lib/postgresql/data
  web:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    image: rkoron/pokedex-rails
    volumes:
      - .:/myapp
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    depends_on:
      - db
    environment:
      DATABASE_URL: postgres://postgres@db
```

Now we can run `docker-compose up -d` and see the application running on
`http://localhost:3000/` (it may take a minute for this to complete). You will
then need to migrate and seed: `docker-compose run web rails db:migrate` &
`docker-compose run web rails db:seed` and you should be up and running.
Amazing! Now anyone can download this project and without having Rails or Node
on their computer they can run `docker-compose up` and they'll have this project
up and running.

## Pushing to Heroku

Once everything is working locally you know it's time to push to the [Heroku
Container Registry][register]!

1. First thing you'll need to do is log in to the Container Registry:
   `heroku container:login`.
2. Then we'll create a new application: `heroku create`
3. We'll then build and push up our images to the registry.
   - We can push up all our Dockerfiles and images by running:
     `heroku container:push --recursive -a {NAME_OF_HEROKU_APP}`
   - If you only wanted to push one of your Dockerfiles you can run:
     `heroku container:push {SERVICE_NAME} --recursive -a {NAME_OF_HEROKU_APP}`
4. Release your now built Images to Containers on Heroku:
   `heroku container:release web frontend -a {NAME_OF_HEROKU_APP}`
5. Now we'll need to add a database `Addon` for our application.
   - On the dashboard for this Heroku application if you look under the
     `Resources` tab you will see the ability to search for and add `Add-ons`.
     - Here is where you can add the `Heroku Postgres` database as an `Add-on`
       for this application
6. Finally we have to migrate and seed our application:
   - Migrations: `heroku run rails db:migrate -a {NAME_OF_APP}`
   - Seeding: `heroku run rails db:seed -a {NAME_OF_APP}`

**Reminder**: We don't have Active Storage on this Application but if we did we
would need add our `master.key` to Heroku too!

And that is it! We can now use `heroku open` to be able to see the Pokedex
application in all it's glory! If you run into any troubles while you are
following this guide make sure to check the `heroku logs` for your application.
